        <h2> Full-Stack Web Developer</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I am a full-stack developer who loves working on beautiful, interactive sites! I have experience with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap/Materialize, Javascript, and jQuery on the front end; Node.JS, Express, SQL, Mongo, Handlebars, and React on the backend. I've worked with MVC Frameworks as well as a CMS such as Worpress. I have a passion for elegantly designed sites and smooth user experiences.

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I am a native of Portland Oregon, although life has taken me allover the country. I completed UNC Chapel Hill's Coding Bootcamp in August, 2017. The Coding Bootcamp is a six month, full stack, intensive course. Before that I spent several years working in childcare; as a Nanny, at a Montessori School, and for a nonprofit. I've decided to switch gears and focus on a career in web development. I also have a bachelor's degree in creative writing, I enjoy the creative and collaborative aspects of web development. When I'm not coding I enjoy riding my bicycle, hiking, cooking veggie meals, making jokes with my friends and reading fiction or scientific books meant for a general audience!
